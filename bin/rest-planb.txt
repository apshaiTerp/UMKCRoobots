In case the REST service crashes, here is what you need to get the service back up and running on another server:

Pre-Requisites:
Java 8 JRE/JDK installed
Maven 3 installed (I've run against 3.2.5 and 3.3.9)
MongoDB Version 3.4.3
 - You can download your OS-specific flavor here: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community

Once all of those things are installed, you need to launch mongod (the database engine)
You can just run 'mongod' from the command prompt, which assumes your database folder location is at /data/db,
or you can route it somewhere specific like this:

mongod --dbpath /home/adam/stuff/mongo/db --port 27017
(NOTE: Will need to run with sudo on Linux/Ubuntu)

The REST service is built with Maven, so to build it yourself, you only need to run the following command:
mvn clean install

This should create your war file under UMKCRoobot/src/roobot-rest/target/roobot-rest-0.9.0.war
To launch this again locally, you can run the following command:

java -jar <your path to>/roobot-rest-0.9.0.war

With that done, assuming your ports are open to the world, you can then host the service yourself.
The rest service does assume Mongo is running against localhost, so for that reason it can't be deployed
on something like Heroku.  Not sure why the mongo connection is so finicky (It's not the client that can't
connect, it's the host who refuses).

So, in case we wind up in trouble and have to move the server somewhere else, here's how.
